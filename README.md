## DataMarket (Supermarket Products)

This is the analysis of a dataset that includes the prices of the products of 3 supermarket brands in Spain (Mercadona, Carrefour and DIA) on a specific date.

## Status

There is currently a beta version 1.0

## Overview

There are countless products that flood the market in supermarkets and consumers continually ask ourselves if we are choosing the best based on quality-price. The great challenge that arises is to be able to analyze the price relationship between the different food groups, either within the same supermarket or with those of its competition. On the other hand, the divergence of taxonomies with which they work is the other great challenge to be addressed.

## Data:


It is a single dataset obtained from the datamarkets website ([Link](https://datamarket.es/))

Its column structure is as follows:
- URL of the product
- Supermarket: it is specified if it is Mercadona, DIA or Carrefour
- Category
- Description
- Price: price at which that product is sold.
- Reference_price: price that refers to the unit of measure (kilograms, liters...)
- Reference_unit: unit of measurement
- Insert_date: day data was collected
- Product_id

## Methodology:

- In the first instance, a brief EDA analysis has been carried out in Python with the pandas library found in the .ipynb document.
- The rest of the analysis has been carried out in the Power BI tool
- The user can interact with various elements of the analysis to obtain their own insights or analysis.
